This guide outlines the steps to git pull a React Native app and run it on your local computer using Expo.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/)

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
Install Dependencies:

npm install

npm start

```
This command will start the Expo development server. You can also use expo start as an alternative.

## Run the App:

Download the Expo Go app from the App Store (for iOS) or Google Play Store (for Android).
Open the Expo Go app and scan the QR code displayed in the terminal or Expo Dev Tools.
The React Native app should now be running on your device or emulator.

## Additional Notes
If running on an emulator, ensure the emulator is already running before starting the development server.
You can modify the code using your preferred code editor and the changes will be reflected live in the running app.
